        <p> My name is Oscar Vanegas and I was born and raised in Leon, Nicaragua. For those who don't know, it's a small
        and beautiful country in Central America. I grew up in a medium sized family and I am the youngest of four brothers and sisters.</p>
        <p> Growing up I used to play a lot of different sports like: basketball, soccer, baseball, boxing and taekwondo. Don't worry I am not lethal.</p>
        <p> I graduated as an Industrial Engineer after obtaining a scholarship playing basketball in college. My hobbies are: working out, playing basketball, playing guitar and spending time with my family.</p>
        <p> I currently work as a Regional Customer Service Manager / Account Manager for a software company based in Johannesburg. I have a fascination about technology and it is the reason why I decided to enroll in the coding botcamp at Georgia Tech.</p>
